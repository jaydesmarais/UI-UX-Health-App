# CMSC434: Intro to Human-Computer Interaction Spring 22/23

### Course Description:

Assess usability by quantitative and qualitative methods. Conduct task analyses, usability tests, expert reviews, and continuing assessments of working products by interviews, surveys, and logging. Apply design processes and guidelines to develop professional quality user interfaces. Build low-fidelity paper mockups, and a high-fidelity prototype using contemporary tools such as graphic editors and a graphical programming environment (eg: Visual Basic, Java).

### Project Notes:

The project in this repo was completed by my group and I as our semester project submission. It is a high-fidelity functional prototype of a health and wellness app.

### Write-Ups:

Write-ups for each of the 4 phases completed for this project can be found in their respective PDF file.
